Just a simple snake game.

I configureted whole project to be click and run on Visual Studio. You should build flawless on VS.
I tried to organise all files neatly. So, it should not be hard to build with other IDEs, compilers, etc.

I used SFML library which refers to Simple Fast Multimedia Library so it can has its own dependencies and licenses, so be aware of that.
